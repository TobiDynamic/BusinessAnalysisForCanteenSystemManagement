<h1>Business Analysis Project For Unilever Canteen Management System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Unileverâ€™s Headquarters is seeking to upgrade its lunchtime process for its 1500 employees working in a building with 12 floors. Currently, it has 2 canteens with a 300 seating capacity, catering to its employees during their 1-hour lunch break. Management seeks to upgrade this process, improve general employee performance, and reduce costs generated from wasted time and unwanted food. 

<h2>Objective</h2>
We propose the development and implementation of a new Canteen Ordering and Management System to improve the efficiency, productivity, and employee satisfaction of our canteen operations. The current manual process is plagued by long waiting times, limited food options, and significant food waste, resulting in high running costs and dissatisfied employees. Our proposed system will streamline ordering, reduce waste, and enhance the overall employee experience.
